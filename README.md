The gaming industry is evolving year after year, and it is no exception that the topic of Steam games is quite popular among young people. There are Counter-Strike and Dota 2 games with over a million owners. Therefore, I am interested in analyzing such data, because I come across it day in and day out. The dataset was taken from data.world. and made by Craigkelly. The selected dataset was provided in 2016 based on 2009 statistics, and in order to provide a more powerful and relevant project project, the new local program will include web parsing of statistics.
Research questions:
